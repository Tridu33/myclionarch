/*能够让前序排列满足拓扑排序的单根DAG都是树，多根DAG都是森林（一个子节点有且只有一个父节点）。

A postorder traversal visits as many of a node’s children as possible, in a consistent order, before visiting the node. (In a cyclic graph, a node’s child may also be its ancestor).

An reverse postorder(RPO) traversal is the opposite - it visits as many of a node’s predecessors as possible before visiting the node itself.
